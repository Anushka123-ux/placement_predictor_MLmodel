# 🎯 AI Prediction Model Based on Logistic regression Algorithm

This project showcases a basic machine learning model that predicts target outcomes using a prebuilt dataset and some synthetic data as well. It was created as part of the 'Microsoft Azure AI Virtual Internship'.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete workflow of a machine learning model — from data generation to prediction — using Python.

We use:
- A 'Placement.CSV' dataset from kaggle is used and also some synthetic data (inorder to improve model performance) is used.
- A 'Linear Regression model'
- Model *training, evaluation, and a "prediction sample" to test the model

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- Scikit-learn (for model creation)  
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)
